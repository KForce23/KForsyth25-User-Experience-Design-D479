    <!-- Island Introduction -->

            <h2>About the Island</h2>
            <p>
                Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square
                miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
                tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an
                indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most of the Tanitian economy
                was
                dominated by fishing or agriculture.
            </p>

            <h2>Tourist Needs</h2>

            <p><strong>Restaurants:</strong> Taniti currently has 11 restaurants: five serve mostly local fish and rice,
                three serve
                American-style meals, and two serve Pan-Asian cuisine.</p>

            <p><strong>Grocery Stores:</strong> Taniti has two supermarkets, two smaller grocery stores, and one
                convenience store that
                is open 24 hours a day.</p>

            <p><strong>Lodging:</strong> Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an inexpensive hostel to
                one large,
                four-star resort. There are many small, family-owned hotels and a growing number of bed and breakfasts.
                All types of
                lodging are strictly regulated and regularly inspected by the Tanitian government.</p>

            <p><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest,
                and visit the
                volcano. However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on
                chartered fishing
                tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs (including a microbrewery),
                dancing at a new dance
                club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and
                bowling. Also, a
                nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are located in
                Merriton Landing, which
                is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.</p>

            <p><strong>Sightseeing:</strong> Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts native
                architecture and
                nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. Other popular activities include boat or bus
                tours of the
                island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to Taniti’s active volcano.</p>

            <p><strong>Transportation:</strong> Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a
                small cruise ship
                that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can
                accommodate small jets
                and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to
                land on the island
                within the next few years.</p>

            <p><strong>Ground Transportation:</strong> Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.
                every day. Private
                buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented
                from a local rental
                agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are
                required by law).
                Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton
                Landing: this area is
                easy to explore on foot.</p>
